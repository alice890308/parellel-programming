National Tsing Hua University - CS 542200 Course's Instructor: Jerry Chou.
This repository includes all the labs and homeworks of this lecture.
# Lab1 Platform Introduction
- The purpose of this lab is to make students get familiar with MPI library and the course platform.
- Problem description:
  - Calculate how many pixels are there in a circle. The radius of the circle is program input parameter.
  - The sequential code is provided with spec. We have to implement the parellel version with MPI library.
# HW1 Odd-Even Sort
- Given the unsorted sequence of numbers, we have to sort them with odd-even sort.
- Implement with MPI library.
# Lab2 Pthread & OpenMP
- The same problem as Lab1, but we have to solve it with different ways:
  - Pthread
  - OpenMP
  - MPI and OpenMP
# HW2 Mandelbrot Set
- Draw a Mandelbrot Set figure with input range
- Implement in two version
  - Pthread
  - MPI and OpenMP
